        <h3>Payroll Management System</h3>
        <p>I designed and developed a web-based payroll management system using PHP, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of the system was to streamline payroll processes for small businesses by automating tasks such as employee record management, salary calculation, and tax deduction. I created the front-end using HTML and CSS and used PHP to implement the back-end functionality, including database management and data processing. The system was designed to be user-friendly and scalable, allowing businesses to easily add or remove employees as needed. Through this project, I gained experience in web development, database management, and problem-solving.</p>

        <h3>Smart Donation App</h3>
        <p>I collaborated with a team of three to design and develop an app for donating books and clothes to NGOs. My contribution to the project included designing a web-based admin panel using HTML, CSS, and Django to provide efficient donation management to the registered NGOs. The project was tailored for a small scale, allowing donors to donate to NGOs located only in their city or town. This project helped me gain valuable experience in web development, project management, and teamwork.</p>
